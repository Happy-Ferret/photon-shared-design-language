# Photon: Shared Design Language
### Our common set of terms used to describe/define the design of Photon, the next iteration of Firefox.

"Photon" is the code name for our next design iteration of Firefox. In order to create a cohesive product across visual design, content, motion, and illustration we have created this set of 6 words to guide and define our work. In doing this we will be able to make better decisions, faster.

**WIP**

#### Adaptable  
Firefox should adapt itself for everyone: From new users to seasoned Mozillians. Customization and control of your web experience is key.

#### Approachable  
Firefox should feel welcoming and friendly.

#### Aware  
Firefox should be perceptive of you and your needs, while remaining respectful of your personal/private space.

#### Quick  
Firefox should feel fast! From task completion to icon animation.

#### Supportive  
Firefox should be helpful in both proactive and passive ways.

#### Whimsical  
Firefox should be fun to use! Our browser should delight the user in both expected and unexpected ways.
