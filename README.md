# Photon: Shared Design Language
### Our common set of terms used to describe/define the design of Photon, the next iteration of Firefox.

"Photon" is the code name for our next design iteration of Firefox. In order to create a cohesive product across visual design, content, motion, and illustration we have created this set of 6 words to guide and define our work. In doing this we will be able to make better decisions, faster.

**WIP**

#### Adaptable  
Firefox should adapt itself to anyone: From new users (simple controls, help/encouragement in using features) to seasoned Mozillians (customization/control of the entire browser experience).

#### Approachable  
Firefox is welcoming, open, and inclusive.

#### Aware  
Firefox is vigilant on behalf of users, providing tools to keep them safe while helping them browse better. Firefox is also perceptive, and looks for signals from users before deciding how to act.

#### Quick  
Firefox should look and feel fast! Frodm task completion to icon animation, Firefox is the most responsive and modern browser.

#### Supportive  
Firefox understands user needs and supports them with relevant experiences. The browser should be helpful in both proactive and passive ways.

#### Whimsical  
Firefox is fun to use! Our browser delights the user in both expected and unexpected ways.
